Level-32 -> Level-33
Description: After all this git stuff, it’s time for another escape. Good luck!
Explanation: We need to escape the shell in order to execute commands, this can be done by passing
             "$0" which shifts it to normal bash shell. Once the normal bash shell loads we can run 
             Command-3 to find the password.
Connection: ssh -p 2220 bandit32@bandit.labs.overthewire.org 
Command-1: $0
Command-2: whoami
Command-3: cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit33
