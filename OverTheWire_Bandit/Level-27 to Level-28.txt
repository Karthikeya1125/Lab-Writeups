Level-27 -> Level-28
Description: There is a git repository at ssh://bandit27-git@bandit.labs.overthewire.org/home/bandit27-git/repo 
             via the port 2220. The password for the user bandit27-git is the same as for the user bandit27.
             From your local machine (not the OverTheWire machine!), clone the repository and find the password 
             for the next level. This needs git installed locally on your machine.
Explanation: Install git on your local system and clone the repository. You need to specify the port 2220 after the
             hostname only then can you access the repository. Carefully look at the syntax of Command-2 for better
             understanding.
