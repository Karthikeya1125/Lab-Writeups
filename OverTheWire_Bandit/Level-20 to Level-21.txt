Level-20 -> Level-21
Description: There is a setuid binary in the homedirectory that does the following: 
             it makes a connection to localhost on the port you specify as a commandline argument. 
             It then reads a line of text from the connection and compares it to the password in the 
             previous level (bandit20). If the password is correct, it will transmit the password for 
             the next level (bandit21).
Explanation: We pass the password of bandit20 to whichever device connects to the listening port.
             We use "nc -l" command to setup a listening port "1234" on our device. To ensure it
             runs in the background we use "&". Then we can continue to use our terminal as usual
