Level-19 -> Level-20
Description: To gain access to the next level, you should use the setuid binary in the homedirectory. 
             Execute it without arguments to find out how to use it. The password for this level 
             can be found in the usual place (/etc/bandit_pass), after you have used the setuid binary.
Explanation: Determine the file permissions using "ls -l" command. The permissions include "s" bit set 
             which means we can run commands with the privileges of user "bandit20" rather than the privileges
             of current user "bandit19"
