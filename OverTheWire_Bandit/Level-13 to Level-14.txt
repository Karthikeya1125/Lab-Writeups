Level-13 -> Level-14
Description: The password for the next level is stored in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 and can only be read 
             by user bandit14. For this level, you don’t get the next password, but you get a private SSH key 
             that can be used to login to the next level. Look at the commands that logged you into previous 
             bandit levels, and find out how to use the key for this level.
Explanation: After logging in to bandit13 we can't directly use the "sshkey.private" to login into bandit14 
             from the same terminal we need to move the private key to our local system using "scp" command.
	     Then login into bandit14 using "ssh" with one small change being the use of "-i <key.private>" 
	     compared to previous levels and then read the password from "/etc/bandit_pass/bandit14".
