Level-29 -> Level-30
Description: There is a git repository at ssh://bandit29-git@bandit.labs.overthewire.org/home/bandit29-git/repo 
             via the port 2220. The password for the user bandit27-git is the same as for the user bandit29.
             From your local machine (not the OverTheWire machine!), clone the repository and find the password 
             for the next level. This needs git installed locally on your machine.
Explanation: Install git on your local system and clone the repository. You need to specify the port 2220 after the
             hostname only then can you access the repository. Carefully look at the syntax of Command-2 for better
             understanding. 
             
             After cloning the repository we list the contents of "README.md" file to find the password 
             being replaced by "<no passwords in production!>". This means the password is visible in other branches. 
             Git contains several non-production branches in which development takes palce before the changes are pushed
             into the production branch(master). 
             
             Find all the other branches(including hidden) using Command-7. 
             Next we notice that there is a "development" branch called "dev" which has a high probability that the 
             passwords are stored in plaintext before being removed when pushed into production. Switch to the "dev"
             branch and read the password in the "README.md" file.
