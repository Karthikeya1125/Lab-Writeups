Level-16 -> Level-17
Description: The credentials for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current 
             level to a port on localhost in the range 31000 to 32000. First find out which of these ports 
             have a server listening on them. Then find out which of those speak SSL/TLS and which don’t.
             There is only 1 server that will give the next credentials, the others will simply send back 
             to you whatever you send to it.
Explanation: Use "nmap" command with the following flags set "-v, -sV, -p" to get more details, service 
             version scan on open ports, and the range of ports to be scanned respectively to identify port
             running SSL. Then you can connect to the specific port running ssl/tls using "openssl" command.
