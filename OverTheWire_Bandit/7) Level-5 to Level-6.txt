Level-5 -> Level-6
Description: The password for the next level is stored in a file somewhere 
under the inhere directory and has all of the following properties:
a) human-readable
b) 1033 bytes in size
c) not executable
Explanation: Due to multiple sub directories being present we use "find ." to recursively go 
             through all sub directories, "-type f" is used to search for only files(excluding directories), 
             "! -executable" removes executable or binary files, "-exec file {} +" executes file command on 
             a batch of files with "{}" being replaced by file paths. The filtered output is piped via "|".
	     "grep" is used to match patterns based on an regex "ASCII".
