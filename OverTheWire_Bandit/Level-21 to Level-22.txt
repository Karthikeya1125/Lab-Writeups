Description: A program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, the time-based job scheduler. 
             Look in /etc/cron.d/ for the configuration and see what command is being executed.
Explanation: Upon accessing the cron schedule we can find that a cronjob created by bandit23 is running.
             On inspecting the contents of the script we can see that the password is stored in a temporary
             directory in a file named "t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv" On accessing the contents of the
             file we get the password.
