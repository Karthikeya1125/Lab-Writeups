Description: A program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, the time-based job scheduler. 
	     Look in /etc/cron.d/ for the configuration and see what command is being executed.
Explanation: Upon accessing the cron schedule we can find that a cronjob created by bandit23 is running. On 
             inspecting the contents of the cronjob script we can that the script takes the current user 
             name and applies md5 hashing on it and the password is stored in a file named with the hash. 
             Post which we access the tmp directory followed by the contents of the file to get the password.
