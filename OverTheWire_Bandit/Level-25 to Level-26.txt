Level-25 -> Level-26
Description:
Explanation: Login to Bandit25 regularly and copy the ssh key to Bandit26 onto your local system. 
            Next find out the login shell which Bandit26 is using by using Command-4. On reading 
            the contents of "/usr/bin/showtext" we can see that it uses "more" command which is 
            the key to cracking this level. Next terminate connection to Bandit25. We will be 
            using a "VIM ESCAPE" which is to resize your terminal window such that the command 
            which is being executed keeps running for a long time than normal which allows you 
            to execute arbitrary commands. After resizing the terminal to smallest possible size 
            attempt a connection to Bandit26 which immediately puts you into "more" mode. Next 
            press "v" to enter visual mode, this is where we will be doing the main work.
            After which use Command-11 to retrieve Bandit26 password. Don't close the connection yet, 
            we will be needing this to get the password for Bandit27.
