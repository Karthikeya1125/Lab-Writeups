Level-2 -> Level-3
Description: The password for the next level is stored in a file called 
	     --spaces in this filename-- located in the home directory.
Explanation: Command-line shells like Bash use the space character as a separator 
             between command-line arguments by default. 
             To overcome this issue we use "\" to escape the space characters.
Connection: ssh -p 2220 bandit2@bandit.labs.overthewire.org
