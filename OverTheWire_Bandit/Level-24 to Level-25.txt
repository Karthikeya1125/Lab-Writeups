Level-24 -> Level-25
Description: A daemon is listening on port 30002 and will give you the password for bandit25 if given the password 
             for bandit24 and a secret numeric 4-digit pincode. There is no way to retrieve the pincode except by 
             going through all of the 10000 combinations, called brute-forcing.
             You do not need to create new connections each time
Explanation: To send bandit 24 password along with pin variations ranging from 0000 to 9999 we make use of "for" loop. 
	      We use "printf" instead of "echo" because it is faster. We connect to the localhost using "nc" command on
	      port 30002 with error messages having status "2" redirected to "/dev/null" to reduce errors being displayed. 
              "grep -q" is used to check if a pattern exists in a file or output, without displaying any results. 
	      If the correct PIN is found it is displayed on screen.
Connection: ssh -p 2220 bandit24@bandit.labs.overthewire.org
