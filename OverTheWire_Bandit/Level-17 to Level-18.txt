Level-17 -> Level-18
Description: There are 2 files in the homedirectory: passwords.old and passwords.new. The password for the next level 
             is in passwords.new and is the only line that has been changed between passwords.old and passwords.new.
Explanation: Create a new file named "sshkey2.key" then store RSA Key content within the file. Use "chmod 600 sshkey2.key" 
             so only file owner has read and write access to the key. Login to the next level like usual, use "diff" command
             to find the difference between the two files and the latter string is the password
Connection: ssh -i sshkey2.key -p 2220 bandit17@bandit.labs.overthewire.org
Command-1: diff passwords.old passwords.new
Level-18 Password: x2gLTTjFwMOhQ8oWNbMN362QKxfRqGlO

Level-18 -> Level-19
Description: The password for the next level is stored in a file readme in the homedirectory. 
             Unfortunately, someone has modified .bashrc to log you out when you log in with SSH.
Explantion: We can directly access the content of the readme file using "cat" command in the "ssh" connection request.
Command-1: ssh -p 2220 bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org cat readme
